Following excellent live programming in elm from @avh4, [episode elm-live AWS Cognito - Part 1 and 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLD59KsHJk)

Today we connect Elm to Javascript with ports, and start making the authentication piece of our serverless backend architecture for Elm apps.

Send me your comments here or on twitter @avh4\. Thanks for watching and trying out Elm!
